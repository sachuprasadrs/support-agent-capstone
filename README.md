# Support Agent Capstone

This project implements a **Context-Aware Customer Support Agent** with:

- Multi-step reasoning (think → act → observe loop)
- Tool calling (mock order lookup, product lookup, ticket creation)
- Session + long-term memory (SQLite)
- Full observability (step-level traces)
- Automated evaluation (LLM-as-judge / heuristic)
- FastAPI demo server
